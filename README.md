# Electron-ulator
A basic electron-calculator, for all platforms, that I created as my first electron-app. I've always tried to make a GUI calculator when I started out programming, but found that C# and Java made it too hard to format things & look good.

## Functions
It has all basic arithmetic, including exponents, squareroots.
Tracks input to allow the user to type values as input.

## Installing
Check out the releases page and download the executable based on your platform!
